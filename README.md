# Tutoring

As a tutor, I have collected and analyzed some data from student assistance sessions, in order to discover how many students attend, the average duration of the sessions, which period of the semester has the highest demand, among other questions.

In general, the questions that guide the analysis do not change from semester to semester, but rather the code, in which I try to implement what I have learned since then.

With the data from 02/2018, I used only lists, dictionaries, and functions from the csv and datetime libraries, in addition to those that do not need to be imported. Now, with the data from 01/2019, the new goal was to familiarize myself with the pandas library.
